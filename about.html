      <h2>History of FlexCar</h2>
      <section class="history-pic pic-1"></section>
      <section>
        <p>One night, in 2019, sitting in the kitchen in Athens, 
          Anton Klymenko and Oleg Sergeev decided to call their former classmate at California State University, 
          Ernest Halimov. He lived for several years in Milan, where in recent years car sharing has started to develop 
          very rapidly. Inspired by the experience of Milan, they decided to try to do it in Athens. Athens, at that time, 
          was suffocating from traffic jams, and paid parking had just begun to appear.</p>
        <p>They were convinced that the idea would take root in Athens and would have a beneficial effect on the transport 
          environment, as the average Athenian used his personal car only 4% of the time, and 96% of the car was idle 
          with dead weight, but at the same time 600 new cars appeared every day on Athensâ€™s crowded roads cars. 
          It became clear: this problem should have some kind of solution, it's time for car sharing.</p>
        <p>But the dream was destined to come true only at the end of 2019, when it became possible to finance the project.</p>
